Welcome to the **Streamlit Basics Repository**! This repository contains a collection of simple scripts that cover the fundamental concepts of building interactive web applications using Streamlit.

## About

Streamlit is a Python library that allows you to create web applications for machine learning and data science projects quickly and easily. With Streamlit, you can create interactive dashboards, data visualizations, and other web-based tools that make it easy to share your data analysis and machine learning models with others.

One of the key benefits of Streamlit is that it automatically handles all of the web development infrastructure for you, including hosting the app and managing the server-side logic. This means that you can focus on building your data analysis and machine learning models, without having to worry about the details of web development.

Overall, Streamlit is a great tool for data scientists, machine learning engineers, and anyone else who wants to quickly create interactive web apps to share their work with others.

## Usage

1. After installing the required dependencies, you can navigate to each script's directory and run the Streamlit app using the following command:

`streamlit run script_name.py`

Replace `script_name.py` with the name of the script you want to run.

2. Once the Streamlit app is running, you can access it in your web browser by opening the provided URL (usually http://localhost:8501).
