Welcome to the **Streamlit Basics Repository**! This repository contains a collection of simple scripts that cover the fundamental concepts of building interactive web applications using Streamlit.

Streamlit is an open-source Python library that allows you to create web applications for data science and machine learning projects with minimal effort. With Streamlit, you can turn your data scripts into shareable web apps in just a few lines of code.

## Usage

1. After installing the required dependencies, you can navigate to each script's directory and run the Streamlit app using the following command:

streamlit run script_name.py

Replace `script_name.py` with the name of the script you want to run.

2. Once the Streamlit app is running, you can access it in your web browser by opening the provided URL (usually http://localhost:8501).
